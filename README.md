# Workouts for iOS

I built Workouts because I wanted a workout log that could be updated with as few taps as possible. It's designed to be unobtrusive and keep you focused. It doesn't connect to the internet or track you. It's intentionally minimal because I want my workouts to be simple. Show up, try to do better than last time, and repeat. Increase the weight or reps when you feel stronger.

It's built with React Native & Expo.
